# `lt-core`

`lt-core` is a small time tracking library designed with extensibility in mind.

- Each task must have a unique id.
- One task can run at a time.

`lt-core` uses [LevelDB](http://leveldb.org) for data storage. Right now it only
works with node, but there are modules that enable the LevelDB API to be used
with IndexedDBâ€”so we could probably make it work in browsers, too.
